   | This was not a design decision. It seems like it would be a sensible    |
   | change but it's very down my personal list of priorities.               |
   |                                                                         |
   | > whether this facilitated implementation                               |
   |                                                                         |
   | This issue does not facilitate implementation. It does not suggest any  |
   | specifics and it does not use the process that we've created to discuss |
   | feature requests.                                                       |
   |                                                                         |
   | > I'd like to collaborate to improve the analytics data                 |
   |                                                                         |
   | Collaboration is best achieved through pull requests.                   |
   |                                                                         |
   | > I haven't invested enough time to understand the implementation       |
   |                                                                         |
   | I would suggest that it's worth doing this before opening issues.       |
   |                                                                         |
   | --                                                                      |
   |                                                                         |
   | As I've mentioned before: I think maintainers opening "personal         |
   | preference" issues they don't plan to work on is a project smell. If    |
   | you're the person who cares about this: you should be the person to     |
   | work on it and unless that's happening in the short-term the best bet   |
   | is to create a pull request when you are ready to work on it. Otherwise |
   | our open issue count keeps growing and growing and it becomes hard to   |
   | keep track of what are actual outstanding problems that need addressed  |
   | and what are just maintainer "nice-to-haves" that will not be worked    |
   \ on.                                                                     /
